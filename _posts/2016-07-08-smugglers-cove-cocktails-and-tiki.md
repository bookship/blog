You know we love a good book here at The Hawaii Project.

You’re pretty sure we love a good cocktail.

Since we’re all about Hawaii and Books, you can guess Tiki culture is in the picture.

Today’s trifecta, the triple crown, the perhaps all-time-best match between us and a book has arrived.

   title="Smuggler’s Cove"
   description="Martin and Rebecca Cate, founders and owners of Smuggler’s Cove (the most acclaimed tiki bar of the modern era) take you on a colorful journey into the lore and legend of tiki: its birth as an escapist fantasy for Depression-era Americans; how exotic cocktails were invented, stolen, and re-invented; Hollywood starlets and scandals; and tiki’s modern-day revival, in this James Beard Award-winning cocktail book. Featuring more than 100 delicious recipes (original and historic), plus a groundbreaking new approach to understanding rum, Smuggler’s Cove is the magnum opus of the contemporary tiki renaissance. Whether you’re looking for a new favorite cocktail, tips on how to trick out your home tiki grotto, help stocking your bar with great rums, or inspiration for your next tiki party, Smuggler’s Cove has everything you need to transform your world into a Polynesian Pop fantasia. Make yourself a Mai Tai, put your favorite exotica record on the hi-fi, and prepare to lose yourself in the fantastical world of tiki, one of the most alluring—and often misunderstood—movements in American cultural history."

Smuggler’s cove, the famous tiki bar in San Francisco, has a book out. OMG. Stop the presses.

In amazing coincidence, we find ourselves in San Francisco on the day we found out about this book. Synchronicity.

We’ll report back after our visit. If we can remember what happened.
