Everybody loves lists, right?

Lists are so much fun! Heck Buzzfeed pretty much made a whole company out of just making lists!

Now you can roll your own book lists on The Hawaii Project! You can share them with your friends on Facebook and Twitter, and they can even add books to your list if you let them! And, each list has a comments section, so you and your friends can comment on or discuss the list.

Lists are a great way of organizing and sharing things. The Hawaii Project has always provided some built-in lists — your Want, Read and Favorites list (and when we make your recommendations we take books on those lists into account). But sometimes, those lists aren’t enough. It’s fun to collect a list of books on a particular topic. Here’s an example: I love books set in bookstores or libraries (like The Shadow of the Wind).

   title="The Shadow of the Wind"
   description="“Gabriel García Márquez meets Umberto Eco meets Jorge Luis Borges for a sprawling magic show.“ --The New York Times Book Review A New York Times Bestseller Barcelona, 1945: A city slowly heals in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, and Daniel, an antiquarian book dealer’s son who mourns the loss of his mother, finds solace in a mysterious book entitled The Shadow of the Wind, by one Julián Carax. But when he sets out to find the author’s other works, he makes a shocking discovery: someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book Carax has written. In fact, Daniel may have the last of Carax’s books in existence. Soon Daniel’s seemingly innocent quest opens a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets--an epic story of murder, madness, and doomed love. “ Anyone who enjoys novels that are scary, erotic, touching, tragic and thrilling should rush right out to the nearest bookstore and pick up The Shadow of the Wind. Really, you should.” --Michael Dirda, The Washington Post “Wonderous... masterful... The Shadow of the Wind is ultimately a love letter to literature, intended for readers as passionate about storytelling as its young hero.“ --Entertainment Weekly (Editor’s Choice) “One gorgeous read.“ --Stephen King From the Trade Paperback edition."

So I made a list of them. I’ve made it _public_ (anyone can see the list) and _collaborative_ (anyone can add to the list). [Have a look here](http://www.thehawaiiproject.com/list/Books-set-in-Bookstores-or-Libraries--8btRQkOefZ), and please! add to the list if you know some great ones.

Creating a list is easy (you need to have an account and be signed in). Just go to **My Stuff** \-> **My Lists**, and hit **Create List**, and off you go. You can add a book to one of your lists from the Books page (the drop-down under the **Want** button), or directly from the list’s page.

Lists are great for book clubs. Just make a page for your book club, and you and your club mates can build a list of books for consideration and discussion.

Let us know what you think!
