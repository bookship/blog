Hello everyone!

I'm pleased to welcome Terese Svoboda to our Meet the Author program, where authors make themselves available to join your book club meetings.

A Guggenheim fellow, Terese Svoboda has won the Bobst Prize in fiction, the Iowa Prize for poetry, an NEH grant for translation, the Graywolf Nonfiction Prize, a Jerome Foundation prize for video, the O. Henry award for the short story, a Bobst prize for the novel, and a Pushcart Prize for the essay. She is a three time winner of the New York Foundation for the Arts fellowship, and has been awarded Headlands, James Merrill, Hawthornden, Yaddo, McDowell, and Bellagio residencies. She's won a lot of awards. I got tired just typing that! Even more - her opera WET premiered at L.A.'s Disney Hall in 2005.

We're pleased to welcome Terese to the program. Here's a note from her introducing herself:

Hi, I'm a content provider. That is to say, I've published 21 books of fiction, poetry, translation, memoir and biography. Two new books of fiction are coming out Feb/March: Roxy and Coco about two wild harpies-turned-social-workers who sometimes throw child abusers off cliffs, and The Long Swim which won the Juniper Prize from U. of Massachusetts, a book about families, good and bad. Escaped lions are also involved.

It's hard for me to read books for fun-- Alice Sadie Celine, an LA novel about a mom who seduces her daughter's best friend is what comes to mind, by Sarah Blakley-Cartwright. You can find me on twitter if you want to hear about any other book recommendations. Happy reading!
