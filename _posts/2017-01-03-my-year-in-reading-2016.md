The irony of building a [book discovery web site](https://www.thehawaiiproject.com) is that my TBR pile gets increasingly huge (~300 books and counting), while I have increasingly less time to read. Still, this year I spent a lot of time on planes. Handling family obligations, traveling to the Anasazi Southwest (and [reading about it](https://www.thehawaiiproject.com/book/The-Chaco-Meridian-One-Thousand-Years-of-Political-and-Religious-Power-in-the-Ancient-Southwest--by--Stephen-H.-Lekson--176285)), traveling to the South Pacific (yes, Hawaii). As a result I had a lot of time to read. 44 books this year, compared to 38 the year before, and 27 the year before that. (I obsessively track what I read, on [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/viking2917&tag=read_2016) (since 2000!), and more recently [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6469580-mark) as well).

For many reasons, it was a personally stressful year; I read more than my fair share of “comfort food” books and guilty pleasures. I aim to do better this year. But still, I read what I read. Here’s what stands out to me.

   title="Saltwater Buddha"
   description="Fed up with teenage life in the suburbs, Jaimal Yogis ran off to Hawaii with little more than a copy of Hermann Hesse’s Siddhartha and enough cash for a surfboard. His journey is a coming-of-age saga that takes him from communes to monasteries, from the warm Pacific to the icy New York shore. Equal parts spiritual memoir and surfer’s tale, this is a chronicle of finding meditative focus in the barrel of a wave and eternal truth in the great salty blue."

**Books that made me smarter or better**. As a result of co-organizing [Books & Spirits](http://www.booksandspirits.com), a bi-monthly author speaking event in Hawaii, I’ve started reading more books focused on the environment, Hawaii and spiritually-oriented books. Not my usual. A standout was **Saltwater Buddha**, by Jaimal Yogis, very wise man who came and spoke at one of our events. You will leave this book with a renewed urgency to live in the moment. I read **The Descendants** by Kaui Hart Hemmings, which really helped me deal with some things going on in my life. It’s special. And her new book **How to Party With an Infant** is absolutely hysterical. Ryan Holiday’s **The Obstacle is the Way** is a refreshingly modern take on the Stoic philosophy. **Shogun** reminded me that [waiting can be a strategy,](http://www.viking2917.com/playing-the-long-game/) and that [management means ultimate responsibility](http://www.viking2917.com/its-all-your-fault/).

   title="Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"
   description="“The first novel in #1 New York Times bestselling author John le Carré’s Karla trilogy The man he knew as “Control” is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus. But George Smiley isn’t quite ready for retirement--especially when a pretty, would-be defector surfaces with a shocking accusation: a Soviet mole has penetrated the highest level of British Intelligence. Relying only on his wits and a small, loyal cadre, Smiley recognizes the hand of Karla--his Moscow Centre nemesis--and sets a trap to catch the traitor. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a heart-stopping tale of international intrigue”--"

**Spy books**. For some reason, this year I read even more spy books than usual. I love the genre — see some [undiscovered gems here](https://medium.com/@thehawaiiproj/the-ten-best-spy-novels-you-never-heard-of-5675c4db1cd5#.8f2acj6l3) — but even so, 15 or so of my 44 books were spy books. Some were not very deep thrillers (Olen Steinhauer, Chris Pavone), some where classics (**Casino Royale** by Ian Fleming, Len Deighton’s **Berlin Game**, a few Alan Fursts), and some were the masters — John Le Carré’s **Tinker Tailor** series, Graham Green’s **Our Man in Havana,** John McCarry’s **The Last Supper**. I also read the simply amazing biography of David Cornwell, aka John Le Carré — **John le Carre: The Biography**, by Adam Sisman. A must, if you are interested in his work. And John Le Carré’s book **The Pigeon Tunnel** — not quite an autobiography, more a collection of stories. But still quite interesting.

   title="The Girl from Venice"
   description="From Martin Cruz Smith, “a master of the international thriller” (The New York Times), a suspenseful World War II love story set against the beauty, mystery, and danger of occupied Venice. Venice, 1945. The war may be waning, but the city known as La Serenissima is still occupied and the people of Italy fear the power of the Third Reich. One night, under a canopy of stars, a fisherman named Cenzo comes across a young woman’s body floating in the lagoon and soon discovers that she is still alive and in trouble. Born to a wealthy Jewish family, Giulia is on the run from the Wehrmacht. Cenzo chooses to protect Giulia rather than hand her over to the Nazis. This act of kindness leads them into the world of Partisans, random executions, the arts of forgery and high explosives, Mussolini’s broken promises, the black market and gold, and, everywhere, the enigmatic maze of the Venice Lagoon. With Martin Cruz Smith’s trademark suspense, action, and breathtaking romance during World War II Italy, The Girl from Venice is “a gripping evocation of a beautiful nation and of two people, trapped in the lunacy of war and the bravery it can inspire” (The Seattle Times)."

**Comfort Food**: After reading Martin Cruz Smith’s newly released **The Girl from Venice**, which I loved, I went back to Arkady Renko, one of my all time favorite characters. **Polar Star** and **Havana Bay**, this year. Arkady is just such a brilliant, morose character, I have to go back and re-read.

**Guilty Pleasure**: Jack Reacher novels. I read 7 of them, plus saw the movie. Gack. They’re good fun, but really? 7?

**Steven Pressfield**. **The Knowledge** and **The Authentic Swing**. A new novel by Pressfield, probably my favorite author, is always a treat. The Knowledge is like no other book he’s written. And The Authentic Swing is great re-motivation for those of you engaged in creative endeavors.

**Books I couldn’t quite finish**. I love Denis Johnson. I got most of the way through **The Laughing Monsters** but got bogged down. I’ll finish this year. I got an advance review copy of **Black Sails, Disco Inferno**, a modern retelling of the Tristan and Iseult legend in a modern day club culture (I’m not making this up). But I just couldn’t finish it. Too wacky.

**Books that made me cry**. I don’t cry easily. And almost never when reading a book. **Song of the Exile** will break you heart. More via my [review](https://medium.com/@thehawaiiproj/song-of-the-exile-by-kiana-davenport-b893b241b7fb#.wugf7x4zn).

From the turbulent years of World War II through Hawaii’s complex journey to statehood, this mesmerizing story presents a cast of richly imagined characters who rise up magnificent and forceful, redeemed by the spiritual power and the awesome beauty of their islands."

Well that’s it for last year. This year, I’m going to try to elevate my reading. Less comfort food, and more books that will improve me. Fewer Jack Reacher books and more books to inspire me, or to give me insight.
